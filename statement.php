                    Every December, when the girls were young, we would load up the car and make the 12-hour drive from
                    Johannesburg, across the haunting beauty of the South African landscape, to holiday by the sea.
                    Everyone in the car lived in a separate world even then,
                    behind the fortified walls of noise-canceling headphones. The older one was halfway into ‘Half of A
                    Yellow Sun,’ Chimamanda Adichie’s groundbreaking fictional exploration of the Biafra War, when she
                    encountered a harrowing rape scene
                    and suddenly cried, “Mom, did that really happen?” <br> Across the landscape of one’s life, every
                    once in a while the untended question of the war will poke through the surface, like a bone from a
                    secret mass grave.

                                theater of our divisions— is bitterly contested territory. In the North, there’s
                                enduring bitterness about the first military coup of Jan. 15, 1966, led by mainly
                                Igbo officers, and in which seemingly the entire political leadership of the north was
